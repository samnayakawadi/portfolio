                <p className="text-gray-500 pt-2">During my tenure at CDAC, I spearheaded the research on the ideal database for a new project. Taking charge of the MeghSikshak Assessment project as the sole developer, I meticulously designed JSON structures for MongoDB collections.</p>
                <p className="text-gray-500 pt-2">Crafting modern user interfaces across three role dashboards and implementing the backend with Spring Boot & Node JS, I assumed full responsibility for project success. Concurrently, I served as a guide for CDAC{"'"}s DAC Course Students, overseeing two batches.</p>
                <p className="text-gray-500 pt-2">This experience, leading a fresh initiative and shouldering responsibilities, was immensely rewarding. Gratitude to Mr. Ramu Sir, Mr. Uday Sir, and Mr. Kumar Sir for their unwavering support.</p>
